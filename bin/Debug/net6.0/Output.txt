To the town of Talladega rode a stranger one fine day
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Blue
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 21
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
There was 50 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the outlaw is still talked about today
There before them lay the body of the ranger on the ground
When he tried to match the outlaw with the big iron on his hip
When he tried to match the outlaw with the big iron on his hip
